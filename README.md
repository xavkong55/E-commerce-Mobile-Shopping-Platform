The Internet has made fundamental changes to human lifestyle and also the way
business is conducted. With the availability of the Internet, more and more people move
from traditional business to online business and it led to the development of Electronic
commerce ( E-Commerce ). By e-commerce, the action of buying and selling will be
done online from any device. This not only eases the burden of a seller by saving the
cost from renting a shop but also saves the time of a buyer from visiting the shop
physically. With the portability of a smartphone, mobile e-commerce applications take
convenience to another level by allowing the user to buy or sell a product anytime,
anywhere.

This project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce mobile application which
allows the user to sell and buy any products or services from the comfort of home
through the Internet. Rather than a traditional market where a customer had to go to the
business to buy a product or service, this project will be transformed into a Consumer to
Consumer (C2C) market that allows customers to engage with one another in an
innovative method. Hence, to achieve the said objective, several features and
functionalities are required including sign up, login, chat with other users, sell products,
buy products and also leave reviews. The expected outcome of this app is to have an
application that has a clean user interface together with the said functionality.
